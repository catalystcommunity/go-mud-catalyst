# go-mud-catalyst

The Catalyst Community MUD, made in Go

This is an experimental core of a MUD meant to be a nice hacking project for a break between more serious projects. It was started by TodPunk as a palate cleanser. The only real goal is to start working towards a simple world that people could chat in, but with support for modern things like being accessible through a web interface through a web socket and getting chat history.

## Current State

Not at all existing or ready.

## Organization

None. None organization.

## Contributing

First open an issue with:

- What you want to do (your feature)
- What your plan to do it is (or none, and we can talk about approaches)
- What your general timeline might be to implement it. You won't be held to the time, but it lets us plan a bit or close things out if something goes wrong.

Yes, this is about you doing the work for your request. That's the point of this thing. We will not accept plain feature requests, and we will not accept PRs where a discussion has not happened prior to the PR being opened.

Have at it! (When we have code to have at, of course)
